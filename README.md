# Suffix Tree and Longest Repeated Substring Implementation

## Overview
This project provides a Java implementation of a Suffix Tree data structure along with a specialized extension for finding the Longest Repeated Substring in a given string.

### Classes
- `CharLinkedListImpl`: Implementation of a linked list for characters.
- `CharLinkedListNodeImpl`: Node implementation for the character linked list.
- `SuffixTreeImpl`: Implementation of a general-purpose Suffix Tree for efficient string manipulation.
- `LongestRepeatedSuffixTreeImpl`: Extension of Suffix Tree for finding the Longest Repeated Substring.
- `SuffixTreeNodeImpl`: Implementation of the nodes used in the Suffix Tree.
